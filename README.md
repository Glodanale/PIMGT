# PIMGT
Physics-Informed Meta Graph Transformer for Travel State Estimation via Traffic Density

Paper by Alex Glover in progress

> Note: MGT_Modified is the work of http://github.com/lonicera-yx/MGT with modifications I made to make the code CUDA compatible.  I made no logical transformations from the original workflow.  This workflow is now compatible with CUDA as tested with ASUS ProArt GeForce RTX 4080 SUPER OC powered by NVIDIA DLSS3
